# Smart Home Utility App

Welcome to the Smart Home Utility App GitHub repository! This repository showcases the collaborative efforts and innovation behind our smart home utility system project. Our goal was to empower users with the ability to effortlessly monitor and manage their water, gas, and electricity consumption through the convenience of smart meters and an intuitive mobile application.

## Project Overview

In this project, I played a pivotal role as the representative and mobile app developer. Working closely with our dedicated team, we embarked on a journey to research, design, and develop a comprehensive solution that redefined how users interact with their utility data.

## Key Contributions

- **Mobile App Development:** Leveraging my expertise in mobile app development, I crafted the heart of our solution â€“ the mobile application. Using React Native and react.js, I created an interface that seamlessly translates complex utility data into a user-friendly dashboard. This ensured that users could effortlessly keep tabs on their consumption patterns in real time.

- **User-Centric Design:** A fellow team member took charge of designing an intuitive user interface and experience using Figma. Our collective effort ensured that users could effortlessly navigate through the app, making data visualization a breeze and allowing them to gain actionable insights from their usage data.

- **Integration of Smart Meters:** I successfully integrated the smart meters with our mobile application, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data collected. This integration bridged the gap between data generation and user access, providing a holistic utility management experience.

- **Data Management with DynamoDB:** A skilled team member developed a robust DynamoDB database and AWS Java Serverless apps to efficiently retrieve and display usage data. This architecture streamlined data management, offering users quick and easy access to their consumption information.

- **Testing and User-Focused Refinement:** With a dedicated team member overseeing testing and debugging, we meticulously ensured the functionality and user-friendliness of the application. We were committed to delivering an effective, accessible, and reliable smart home utility system.

## Continuous Improvement

Our journey doesn't end here. We remain committed to enhancing the application based on user feedback and the collective insights of our team. By staying responsive to evolving user needs, we aim to maintain the relevance and value of our smart home utility app as a dependable tool for managing utility consumption.
